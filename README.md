## ‚ö° Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syed-Saleh-Programmer/news-app.git
   cd news-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your NewsAPI key:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```
     NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key_here
     ```
   - **Do NOT use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix** to keep your API key private.

   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.**

## üîí Environment Variables

- `NEWS_API_KEY`  
  Your [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/) key.  
  **Keep this private** (do not use `NEXT_PUBLIC_`).

---

## üß© How It Works

- **Server Components** fetch news data using utility functions in `src/data/newsApi.js`.
- **Revalidation** is set to 5 minutes (`revalidate: 300`), so news stays fresh without slowing down the site.
- **Client Components** handle navigation, search, and UI interactivity.
- **Favicon** is set via `public/favicon.ico` and referenced in `src/app/layout.jsx`.

---

## üìù Customization

- **Add/Remove Categories:** Edit `src/data/categories.js`.
- **Change Styling:** Modify Tailwind classes in component files.
- **Update Favicon:** Replace `public/favicon.ico` with your own.
